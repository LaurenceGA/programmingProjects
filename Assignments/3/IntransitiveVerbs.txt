growled
drank to a stupor
evaporated
staggered
bounced
twirls
buzzes
laughed
exploded
coughed
leaves
sleeps
obliterates
hibernates
breathes
self-flagellates
meditates
rises from the depths
flies into a rage
sows the seeds of its own damnation
sweeps the floor
returns
rejoices
prays
procrastinates
dreams
ceases to exist
hides
panics
beams with power
laughs like a man insane
draws itself up
awakens
hesitates
trembles
ruminates
dies
