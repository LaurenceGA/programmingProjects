Game of Life

HOW THE ALGORITHM WORKS
The algorithm works such that it finds the surrounding coordinates of every living cell, that is every cell that is a neighbour to a living one.

This function works by using for loops to build a list of surrounding coordinates.
CConditional expressions to make sure the coordinates don't go off the board.

The neighbours_cyclic function does the same thing but instead of using conditional expressions to avoid improper indexing,
it loops the invalid indexes around to the other side of the board.

Back in the nextgen function this list of lists of tuples is converted into one big list of tuples using list comprehension.
It then loops through a version of the list that has been cast to a set to remove any duplicates.
This increases efficiency as cells aren't checked unnecessarily.

The rules of the game of life are then used to construct the list of next gen cells.

SHAPE EXPERIMENTATION
Shapes found from wikipedia such as the blinker, glider and the cross and the outcomes were as detailed.

BOARD TYPE EXPERIMENTATION
The basic neighbours function written produces a finite board in which the edges of the screen acted like walls of death which would mostly kill cells.
The neighbours_cyclic version loops the board around which meant that shapes were allowed to get much larger.
Problems could arise though where come shapes looped around and killed shapes on the other side of the board.
