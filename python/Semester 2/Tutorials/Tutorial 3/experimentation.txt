Experimentation done:

Blocks:
Having a slight gap between the blocks allows for them to be seen clearly.

Snowmen:
Looks best when it shrinks until infinitely small and goes most of the way across the screen.

Sierpinski:
Works for all different sizes and locations, drawing is consistent with parameters given.
Looks great when draw_triangle method is altered such that the colour argument is a random colour.
