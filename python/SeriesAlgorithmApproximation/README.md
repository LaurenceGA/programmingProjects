# Series approximation

A collection of programs that through the use of infinite mathematical series' approximate constants.  
Constants approximated are pi and e.  

Initially personally formulated taylor (specifically McLaurin) series' were used.  
Later in some other programs other various formulas (such as David Bailey's spigot formula) were used.
