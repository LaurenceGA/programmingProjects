# projects

Collection of small projects that do random things.  

## Number guessing
Guess my number is a small number guessing game.  
Number guessed is essentially plays that game a bunch of times then gives interesting statistics.  

## Hash Pass
A program that will attempt to create a large (very large) file of hashed password combinations.  
Completely pointless when any website just uses password salt.
